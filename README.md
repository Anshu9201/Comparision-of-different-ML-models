# Comparision-of-different-ML-models
This project compares multiple machine learning models on the same dataset to identify the best performer for accurate predictions.

# Models used
In this project, several machine learning models were utilized, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression. Each model was evaluated to identify the best performer for the predictive task.

# Evaluation metrics
The models were evaluated using two key metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score. MAE measures the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values, providing insight into the model's accuracy. The R² Score indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model, reflecting how well the model fits the data. Together, these metrics help assess the performance of each model and identify the most effective one for the predictive task.

# Result
By comparing the evaluation metrics, we found that Linear Regression outperformed the other models with the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the highest R² Score, indicating it is the best model for this predictive task. This analysis highlights its effectiveness in accurately predicting outcomes compared to the other algorithms evaluated.
